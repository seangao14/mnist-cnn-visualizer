View pretty images in [playground.ipynb](playground.ipynb)

## to run the notebook locally:
The only files/folders you'll need are playground.ipynb and the 'data'&'models' folders. Although cuda is used for training, you dont need it if you simply want to play around with the visualization tools with the pre-trained model.

to play with it:
  ctrl+f for "NUM" and "NUM_NUMS" and change them to whatever you wish and hit run to see pretty images come up!
